# Data Driven Insights for Exception Prediction in Transport Order Management
In modern supply chain operations, even a small disruption can ripple across the entire logistics network. This project addresses a critical issue in transport management: identifying transport orders that are likely to result in volume-related exceptionsâ€”before they happen.

By combining historical data analysis and machine learning, this project provides a predictive solution that helps reduce manual effort, avoid production delays, and optimize logistics operations.

## Project Objective

Every day, suppliers release transport orders with planned shipment details like pickup date, weight, volume, and number of pallets. However, real-world pickups often deviate from this plan: the supplier may ship more, less, or even fail to ship altogether. These deviations are called **exceptions**, and they:

- Interrupt the flow of goods

- Increase workload for logistics teams

- Potentially cause costly production downtimes

The goal of this project is to **predict these exceptions in advance** using machine learning, allowing companies to take preventive action.

The core model used in this project is the Random Forest Classifier, chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data without overfitting.

To make the model accessible to business users and non-technical stakeholders, a Tkinter-based GUI was developed. This interface allows users to interact with the trained machine learning model without writing any code.

**Features:**
- Input transport order data manually or via file
- Get real-time predictions
- View exception risk directly in the app
